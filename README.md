Try [HuggingFace ü§ó space app](https://huggingface.co/spaces/thatupiso/Podcastfy.ai_demo) for a simple use case (URLs -> Audio).

See Python package and CLI at the original [Podcastfy's github repo](www.podcastfy.ai) for full customization options.

WARNING: This UI App was not as thoroughly tested as the Python package.

Podcastfy is an open-source Python package that transforms web content, PDFs, and text into engaging, multi-lingual audio conversations using GenAI. 

Unlike UI-based tools focused primarily on note-taking or research synthesis (e.g. NotebookLM ‚ù§Ô∏è), Podcastfy focuses on the programmatic and bespoke generation of engaging, conversational transcripts and audio from a multitude of text sources therefore enabling customization and scale.
